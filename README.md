STARS - Suspicious Trips and Activity Reporting System :star:

This is simply a proof-of-concept proposal to leverage on the user base(drivers) on various ride sharing applications like Uber and Lyft to employ their aid in determining trips and/or activities through the means of a simple reporting feature.

## Idea
1. Ride sharing applications like Uber and Lyft have implemented API servers to allow integration of third-party applications with their platform.
2. These API endpoints allow for drivers to `POST` their recent _Trip History_. With these _Trip History_, we believe we can identify potential hot spots for human trafficking. 
3. Leveraging on these hot spots, we can incorporate the FaceBook chatbot solution to enable better market targetting.
